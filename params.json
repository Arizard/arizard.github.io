Mostly lua, maybe Unity/C# in future.\r\n\r\n#Deathrun Neue\r\n\r\n![Deathrun Neue Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/VUSsFoL.png)\r\n\r\nDeathrun Neue is a comprehensive, feature-rich Deathrun gamemode produced by Arizard with the help of testers such as Zelpa, Impetulio, Baksus (and the Redline Gaming community) and A Faceless Baby. This gamemode comes standard with many popular Deathrun features - such as thirdperson mode, pointshop support (PS 1, PS 2), AFK timers, and a nominate/rtv mapvote system. The gamemode also includes lesser-known features, such as automatic button claiming, custom crosshairs, death avoidance punishments, and trigger zones.\r\n\r\nThe gamemode also has a focus on customisability, featuring various client-side convars for each player's unique tastes, and also serverside convars to allow owners customize their server's gameplay.\r\n\r\n[Click here to visit the Facepunch thread](http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1476758)\r\n\r\n[Click here to visit the github repo](https://github.com/Arizard/deathrun)\r\n\r\n#RedactedHub\r\n\r\n![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0d041179bfec49c89ba2bf255d47383523bc733a/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6d6756444f76722e6a7067)\r\n\r\nRedactedhub is a multi-purpose server hub which I created for my community. It features a point system, item store (cosmetic and augmenting), jukebox (using youtube videos as the source), a donation link, as well as 2 spare panels in which I hope to add item trading and an admin control panel.\r\n\r\nRedactedHub differs from other pointstores due to the way items are stored. Each item is an individual row in a table, and each row has a specified owner. This means that it is possible to have a limited number of units of each item, improving a server's point economy. Once a limit for a certain item is reached, there can be no more sold, thus causing the players to trade the item at a higher value as demand increases. Points are also finite, which means that the store starts off with a certain amount of cash, and as points are given out, cash in the store is depleted - there is a limit where the store can no longer give out points, and the players will need to trade between eachother or purchase more items from the store, causing points to increase in value due to them being harder to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe jukebox features a playlist (which changes depending on the server you are on) and a queue, which stores songs that you have added from the playlist. If a song is added to your queue, you will still be able to listen to it if you join another server with RedactedHub installed - the queue is stored on your client and remains the same regardless of the server you are on.\r\n\r\n#Scriptfodder\r\nI have released a number of addons on scriptfodder so far:\r\n##doorSkin\r\ndoorSkin provides an intuitive interface for new DarkRP players to change the appearance of the doors they own!\r\n\r\nIt only takes a few seconds! doorSkin allows you and your friends to enhance their roleplay immersion and decorate their bases! It's sure to keep players sticking around!\r\n\r\nFormerly, only administrators with access to world props were able to customize the appearance of their doors. Now, with doorSkin, any player can edit the appearance of any door they own!\r\n\r\nChoose steel doors with pushbars for warehouses and industrial complexes!\r\n\r\nVarnished wooden doors with tasteful iron handles for the Mayor's office!\r\n\r\nDingy, scrappy plywood doors for those crafty Hobo shacks and slum areas!\r\n\r\n[doorSkin on ScriptFodder](https://scriptfodder.com/scripts/view/1110)\r\n\r\n##doorHandle\r\nHave you ever wanted more out of your doors? Is the default DarkRP labeling system just not that appealing? Do you and your players want improved customization for gun stores, bars, restaurants and garages?\r\n\r\nThe tried-and-true 3D2D door label just received an upgrade - doorHandle.\r\n\r\ndoorHandle is an intuitive new addon which improves the appearance of the default DarkRP door labels, while providing extra customization for all players and all doors! Not only does it let players customize their bases, but it's eye-catching aesthetic is sure to garner the attention of new players and keep them sticking around!\r\n\r\ndoorHandle allows players to edit the color, scale, and font of their door labels, and puts them in control of how their base looks.\r\n\r\n[doorHandle on ScriptFodder](https://scriptfodder.com/scripts/view/1120)\r\n\r\n##bodyGroupr\r\n\r\nToo often have we needed to sit down and wait for hundreds of megabytes of playermodels to download. It's a pain, and we're sick of it.\r\n\r\nBut what if we didn't have to? What if there was an addon that allowed us to unlock the full potential of many workshop playermodel packs?\r\n\r\nBodygroups, if you haven't heard of them by now, are small changes to a playermodel's appearance (such as clothing) which are included within the model's files. Rather than having separate playermodels for each different item of clothing, bodygroups allow you to interchange, switch, swap, and shuffle your playermodel's appearance to any combination you desire.\r\n\r\nWhen using bodyGroupr, these bodygroups are no longer locked away in the code, and can be accessed freely by the players. This way, you (the owner) can minimize the disk space and network bandwidth that gets wasted each time a new player joins!\r\n\r\n[bodyGroupr on ScriptFodder](https://scriptfodder.com/scripts/view/1217)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
